This is Qingyu Li's personal homepage.  

## A short introduction
I am an assistant professor at the School of Science and Engineering of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). I received my Ph.D. from the Technical University of Munich. I received my Bachelor's degree in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from Wuhan University, China; I obtained my double Master's Degree, which is (1) ESPACE, Technical University of Munich, Germany, and (2) Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, China. 

## News
Our lab at CUHK-Shenzhen is dedicated to harnessing the power of AI and big data to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing our world today. Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies for interdisciplinary research, including areas such as Smart City, Energy Analysis, Climate Change, Disaster Management, etc.

I am actively seeking self-motivated PhD / MPhil students (MPhil-PhD Programme in Computer and Information Engineering in Spring 26/ Fall 2026) and research assistants. Moreover, postdocs and visiting students are also welcome to apply. Please drop me an email with your CV and transcript through <b>liqingyu@cuhk.edu.cn</b> if interested.
